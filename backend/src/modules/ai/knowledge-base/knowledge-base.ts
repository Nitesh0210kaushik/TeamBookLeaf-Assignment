  company: `Company overview
- BookLeaf Publishing is a self-publishing company operating in India and the US.
- Publishing packages: Standard Free (no upfront cost) and Bestseller Breakthrough (premium, paid package with marketing and distribution add-ons).
- BookLeaf handles cover design, typesetting, ISBN assignment, printing, distribution and royalty management for its authors.
- In-house printing facility and warehouse in Delhi; print partners include Repro India and Epitome Books.`,

  royalty: `Royalty policy
- 80/20 royalty split: 80% of the net profit per book goes to the author, 20% to BookLeaf.
- Net profit = MRP minus printing cost, platform commission (Amazon/Flipkart) and shipping charges.
- Royalties are calculated quarterly and paid within 45 days of the quarter ending.
- Minimum payout threshold: ₹1,000. If accumulated royalties are below this, they roll over to the next quarter.
- Payouts are made via bank transfer to the bank account linked in the author's dashboard.
- Authors can view a detailed royalty breakdown in their dashboard, showing sales figures per platform. A line-by-line breakdown can also be shared on request.
- If a payout is genuinely overdue, escalate to the finance team with a 48-hour resolution timeline.`,

  isbn: `ISBN & metadata policy
- Every book published through BookLeaf receives a unique ISBN assigned by BookLeaf.
- ISBNs are registered under BookLeaf's publisher imprint. Authors who want an ISBN under their own imprint must obtain it independently.
- An ISBN error (duplicate, wrong book linked, mismatch between platform and print) is a high-priority issue and is escalated to the production team immediately, with a 48-hour resolution timeline.
- Metadata updates (description, etc.) can be submitted through the dashboard or by emailing the BookLeaf team; changes typically reflect on platforms within 3–5 business days.`,

  printing: `Printing & quality policy
- In-house printing handles most orders. Overflow or specific format requirements go to Repro India or Epitome Books.
- Standard print turnaround: 5–7 business days from order confirmation.
- For quality issues (misprints, binding defects, colour inconsistency, blurry images), BookLeaf arranges a free reprint after verification. The author may need to share photos of the defective copy. Reprints follow the 5–7 business day turnaround.`,

  distribution: `Distribution & availability policy
- Books are listed on Amazon India, Flipkart, Amazon US, Amazon UK and the BookLeaf Store.
- New listings typically go live within 7–10 business days after publication is complete.
- A book showing as unavailable on a platform usually indicates a stock sync issue; BookLeaf's team can trigger a re-sync, and the listing is typically live again within 24–48 hours.`,

  production: `Production stages
- Stages in order: Manuscript Received → Editing (if opted) → Cover Design → Typesetting → Proofreading → ISBN Assignment → Printing → Distribution Setup → Published & Live.
- Authors are updated at each stage via email.
- Delays typically happen at Cover Design (waiting for author approval) and Proofreading (revision rounds).`,

- Acknowledge the author's concern before jumping to solutions.
- Be specific: include actual numbers, dates and statuses wherever possible rather than vague reassurances.
- If something is BookLeaf's fault (delayed royalties, ISBN error), own it directly. No corporate deflection.
- If the issue requires escalation or investigation, give a clear timeline ("Our team will look into this and get back to you within 48 hours") rather than open-ended promises.
- Always end with a clear next step for the author and/or the BookLeaf team.`;
